### **üõ≥Ô∏èWhat is Dockerfile?**

Dockerfile is a text file that contains some set of instructions automation of Docker image creation. A Dockerfile specifies everything needed to set up an application or service within a container.

There are a few steps inside the Dockerfile to create a Docker image.

1. **Base Image**: The Dockerfile starts with selecting a base image from which your application will be built. The base image provides a foundation with a specific operating system and pre-installed software. For example, you might use an official Ubuntu or Alpine Linux base image.
    
2. **Instructions**: Dockerfiles consist of a series of instructions, each representing a step in the process of building the image. Common instructions include:
    
    * `FROM`: Specifies the base image.
        
    * `RUN`: Executes commands in the container during the build process.
        
    * `COPY` or `ADD`: Copies files from the host machine into the image.
        
    * `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory within the image.
        
    * `EXPOSE`: Documents which ports the container will listen on at runtime.
        
    * `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`: Defines the command or executable that will run when the container starts.
        

### **\*Ô∏è‚É£Tasks**:

**‚úÖCreate a Dockerfile for a simple web application (e.g. a Node.js or Python app)**

there are a few steps to creating a Dockerfile for an application

1. create a directory like a web-application name eg. node-app
    
2. Go inside the directory
    
3. git clone that from the developer repo.
    
4. Now go inside the developer repo
    
5. Now create Dockerfile and write a set of instructions that require to create a Docker image.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir node-app
    cd node-app/
    node-app git clone repository url
    node-app/repo-project-name
    vi Dockerfile
    ```
    
    ! Remember that when you create Dockerfile write <mark>D </mark> always capital

**‚úÖBuild the image using the Dockerfile and run the container**

1. Now after completing the Dockerfile create a Docker image
    

```bash
docker build . -t node-app:latest
Docker images
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 node-app:latest
```

**‚úÖVerify that the application is working as expected by accessing it in a web browser**

1. Now go to the Ec2 instance click on security click on security group

1. Now click on edit inbound rules. and add rules and enable port 8000
    

with anywhere IPv4

Congrats your application has been deployed on AWS successfully

**‚úÖPush the image to a public or private repository (e.g. Docker Hub )**

* Follow some steps to push your image on the docker hub/registry(private)
    
* After creating a docker image.
    
* docker login
    
* Enter your username and password
    
* Now give the tag to your image name that you have created with the new image name that you want to show on your docker hub account.
    

```bash
docker tag imagename dockerid/newimagename
```

* Now push your image on the docker hub
    

```bash
docker push dockerid/newimagename
```

* Now you can see your image on your docker hub

you can make your docker image private:

* Click on the image that you want to do private
    
* click on public then click on setting Go on visibility mode then you can make your image privately

**‚úÖCreate a Dockerfile for a simple web application Django Python app**

there are a few steps to creating a Dockerfile for an application

1. create a directory like a web-application name eg. django-app
    
2. Go inside the directory
    
3. git clone that from the developer repo.
    
4. Now go inside the developer repo
    
5. Now create Dockerfile and write a set of instrumentation that require to create a Docker image.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir django-app
    cd django-app/
    django-app git clone repository url
    django-app/repo-project-name
    vi Dockerfile
    ```
    

! Remember that when you create Dockerfile write <mark>D </mark> always capital

* Now after completing the Dockerfile create a Docker image
    

```bash

### **üìçConclusion:**

Above mentioned information is much important for a DevOps engineer we have leant about the docker file and what is docker file uses of docker file to create a docker image and we created a node. js and django application on AWS and push the docker image on the docker hub Embrace version control and collaboration, and your coding adventures shall know no bounds!

So I encourage you to try this on your own and let me know in the comment section about your learning experience
