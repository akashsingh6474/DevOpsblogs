[**🐧What is Linux?**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/akash-singh-48689a176_linux-for-beginners-basic-commands-activity-7086353270431989760-feLK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android)

Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various operating systems, commonly referred to as Linux distributions. Created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, Linux has since become one of the most widely used operating systems in the world.

Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It operates on a wide range of devices, from personal computers to servers, smartphones, embedded systems, and supercomputers. Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS, build upon the Linux kernel and provide a complete operating system with additional software and tools.

### **👩‍💻what is the History of Linux?**

A popular open-source operating system is Linux. It was initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Torvalds was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland and began working on the Linux project as a personal endeavor.

Today, Linux is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, with an estimated 2.76% of all desktop computers and more than 90% of the world’s top supercomputers running on Linux, and approx. 71.85% of all mobile devices run on Android, which is, you guessed it, Linux-based.

### **🎉features of Linux.**

✅It's open source.

✅It's very secure and easy to use.

✅Smiplified updates for all installed software.

✅It's very lightweight.

✅Linux is multiuser-multitask.

✅It has multiple distributions eg. Redhat, Debian, Fedora etc.

### 🎲Architecture of Linux.

![Architecture of Linux - javatpoint](https://static.javatpoint.com/linux/images/architecture-of-linux.png align="center")

**🎯Hardware Layer:** This layer consists of all peripheral devices like RAM/ HDD/ CPU etc.

**🎯Kernel:** The kernel is the core of the operating system. It is responsible for managing the hardware, scheduling tasks, and providing basic services to the other components of the operating system.

**🎯Shell:** The shell is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel. It is the interface that users use to run commands and applications.

**🎯GNU Utilities:** GNU utilities are a collection of free and open-source software that provides a wide range of functionality, such as text editing, file compression, and networking.

### **🛞Linux File Hierarchy Structure.**

![Linux File System Hierarchy – nepalisupport](https://nepalisupport.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/linux-filesystem.png align="center")

/root:- it is the home directory for the root users

/home:- Home directory for the users.

/boot: -it contains bootable files for Linux.

/etc:- it contains all configuration files

/usr: - by default software is installed in this directory.

/bin:- it contains commands used by all users.

/sbin:- It contains commands used by only the root user.

/opt- optional application software package.

/dev:- Essential device files include terminal devices, usb or any device attached to the system

### **☑️Linux commands and Uses :**

There are Some of the most basic Linux commands include:

1. `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
    
    eg:- ls -l (lists files in long format)
    
2. `cd`: Changes the current directory.
    
    `eg:- cd /path/to/directory` (changes to a specific directory)
    
3. `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
    
4. history:-It show the list of previously used commands.
    
5. date:- It shows the date and time.
    
6. whoami:- its shows the current login username.
    

**Cat Command:**

the cat command is one of the most universal tool, yet all it does is copy standard input to standard output.

```plaintext
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-116:~$ cat >file1
```

this command is use to concat the files.

```plaintext
cat file1 file2 >file3
```

**touch**:

touch command is use to create multiple empty files

```plaintext
touch /blog{1..5}
```

**mkdir**:

it's use to create directory -p is used to create multiple directory in side the directory

```plaintext
mkdir abhinav
```

```plaintext
mkdir -p abhinav/test/devops
```

```plaintext
 for multiple directory
mkdir /new {1..10}
```

**cp**:- this command is used to copy the file

```plaintext
cp file1 file2
```

**mv**:- this command is used to move the file one to another file and also is use for rename the file name

```plaintext
mv file3 file4
```

```plaintext
my file3 newfile
```

**echo**: Its is use for print the data.

```plaintext
echo "hello this is linux blog"
```

📍**Conclusion** These are just a few of the most important basic Linux commands. There are many other commands that you can learn, but these will give you a good foundation for working with Linux.

I encourage you to practice using these commands so that you can become comfortable with them. The more you use them, the easier they will become.
