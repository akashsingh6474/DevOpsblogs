### **üÖøÔ∏èWhat is a python**

Python is a popular high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles

it is easy to learn and understandable it's a very easy language.

Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.

It is used for:

* web development (server-side),
    
* software development,
    
* mathematics,
    
* system scripting.
    

Key features of Python include:

1. **Readable and Expressive Syntax**: Python's syntax emphasizes readability and uses indentation to delimit code blocks, making it easy for programmers to understand and maintain the code.
    
2. **Dynamic Typing**: Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to specify the data type of variables explicitly. The type is inferred at runtime.
    
3. **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, which allows for rapid development and easy debugging.
    
4. **Large Standard Library**: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides many modules and packages for common tasks, such as working with files, networking, databases, and more.
    
5. **Multi-paradigm**: Python supports various programming styles, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
    
6. **Platform Independence**: Python is a cross-platform language, meaning that code written in Python can be executed on different operating systems without modification.
    
7. **Open Source**: Python is an open-source language, and its community actively contributes to its development, creating a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
    
8. python has an extension is "py" When we want to save the file we can save the file with **.py**
    
    ```bash
    hello.py
    ```

**Numeric**:

1. integer
    
2. float
    
3. complex number
    

**Dictionary, Boolean, Set**

**Sequence type**

1. String
    
2. list
    
3. tuple
    

### **‚ú®Conclusion**

Congratulations! You've completed Day 13 of the #90DaysOfDevOps challenge.
